### Books CRUD api

### Implemented:

```
Comments - get/create
Books - full CRUD
Authors - full CRUD
```

#### I see no reason to edit or delete comment because they are anonymous

### To run app use:

```
docker-compose up
```

(do not forget to change port to 5000 in client app if are you using docker, if not, change it to 4000 (client default api port))
